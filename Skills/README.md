# Skills

AI skills are instruction files that give a Copilot agent a focused capability. Each skill lives in its own folder and is installed by uploading that folder to the **Skills** library in SharePoint.

Some skills also include a `demo/` subfolder containing sample content you can use to try the skill end-to-end (e.g., [`libraries/library-cleanup/demo/`](./libraries/library-cleanup/demo/)). When uploading a skill folder to SharePoint, simply skip the `demo/` subfolder — only `SKILL.md` is required for the skill to run.

## Libraries

| Folder | Skill | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [file-classifier/](./libraries/file-classifier/) | File Classifier | Classifies files in a SharePoint document library by reading their content and matching them to known content types (Contracts, Invoices, Purchase Orders). Creates the appropriate metadata columns, extracts values from each file, and saves them automatically. Use when asked to classify, tag, or extract metadata from documents in a library. |
| [library-cleanup/](./libraries/library-cleanup/) | Library Cleanup | Organizes a document library by scanning for duplicates, bad file names, empty folders, and excessive nesting. Reads file content to generate meaningful rename suggestions, presents a visual before/after comparison with an Organization Score, then executes the full cleanup with a live TODO checklist the user can follow along with. Triggered when someone says "clean up file demo". |
| [organize-library/](./libraries/organize-library/) | Organize Library | Fully organizes a SharePoint document library end-to-end: classifies files by content type, applies brand-consistent column formatting (pills, data bars, overdue highlights), creates filtered views per content type, colors folders, and sets up notification rules for overdue items. Orchestrates the file-classifier skill and reads SHAREPOINT.md for brand colors. |

## Operations

| Folder | Skill | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [invoice-po-reconciliation/](./operations/invoice-po-reconciliation/) | Invoice ↔ PO Reconciliation | Reconciles one or more user-selected invoice files against matching purchase orders. Compares totals, flags discrepancies, writes reconciliation status back to invoice metadata, and returns a formatted summary table. |
| [site-storage-heatmap/](./operations/site-storage-heatmap/) | Site Storage Heatmap | Generates an interactive HTML site map showing storage breakdown and hot/cold activity heatmap across all document libraries, lists, and site pages. Includes site-wide summary stacked bars and per-library click-through drill-downs. Saves the file to the site's document library and navigates the user directly to it. |

## Styling

The styling category contains one engine (`list-styling`) and a set of style token skills that the engine consumes. Pick a style token to define the look, then run `list-styling` to apply it.

| Folder | Skill | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [list-styling/](./styling/list-styling/) | List Styling Engine | Transforms SharePoint lists and document libraries into fully art-directed views using column, view, and row formatting. Pairs with any of the style token skills below to define the look. |
| [style-bento/](./styling/style-bento/) | Style: Bento | Bento-inspired horizontal compartment cards with warm earth tones, compact uppercase badges, and visible dividers. Triggers: *bento, warm style, earth tones, muted colors.* |
| [style-blueprint/](./styling/style-blueprint/) | Style: Blueprint | Engineering-drawing aesthetic with a monochromatic blue palette, double-ring rubber-stamp badges, and an ultra-compact two-line spec-sheet card. Triggers: *blueprint, technical drawing, engineering, schematic, spec sheet.* |
| [style-figma-clean/](./styling/style-figma-clean/) | Style: Figma Clean | Polished professional aesthetic with self-colored badge borders and thin precise progress bars. Triggers: *figma, clean style, polished, professional.* |
| [style-glassmorphism/](./styling/style-glassmorphism/) | Style: Glassmorphism | Soft pill badges with no borders, thin bars, and an airy frosted-glass aesthetic. Triggers: *glassmorphism, frosted glass, glass look, soft modern.* |
| [style-high-contrast/](./styling/style-high-contrast/) | Style: High Contrast | Maximum contrast ratios, larger fonts, thicker weights, and text indicators for WCAG accessibility compliance. Triggers: *high contrast, accessible, accessibility, WCAG, easy to read.* |
| [style-monochrome/](./styling/style-monochrome/) | Style: Monochrome | A single slate-blue hue from light to dark replacing traffic-light colors — calm, corporate, tonal. Triggers: *monochrome, single color, one hue, corporate design system, all blue, tonal.* |
| [style-neobrutalism/](./styling/style-neobrutalism/) | Style: Neobrutalism | Thick black borders, saturated colors, uppercase text, and hard offset shadows. Two-panel cards with red flip on overdue. Triggers: *neobrutalism, brutalist, bold borders, chunky style.* |
| [style-pastel/](./styling/style-pastel/) | Style: Pastel | Soft candy colors with light tinted badge backgrounds and dark text — friendly and approachable. Triggers: *pastel, soft colors, candy, light badges, friendly style, approachable.* |
| [style-retro/](./styling/style-retro/) | Style: Retro Memphis | Hot pink, electric blue, yellow, and teal with colored borders — bold, playful, nostalgic. Triggers: *retro, memphis, 80s, 90s, colorful, playful, bright colors.* |
| [style-terminal/](./styling/style-terminal/) | Style: Terminal | Dark badges with neon green accents and matrix-style progress bars. Triggers: *terminal, hacker, dark mode, matrix, developer style, green on black.* |

## Installing a Skill

Skills follow the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). The `Skills/` library in SharePoint is created automatically — install by uploading the skill folder into it.

1. Download the skill folder (e.g., `file-classifier/`)
2. In your SharePoint site, open the **Agent Assets** library
3. Navigate into the **Skills** folder (auto-created)
4. Upload the skill folder — the agent discovers it by the `name` field in `SKILL.md`

## Creating a Skill

A skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` plus supporting files. The folder lives inside a category subfolder and the folder name must match the `name` field in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter exactly.

### Where it goes

**In this repo:** `Skills/<category>/<skill-name>/`

**In SharePoint:** `Skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — when uploading, take just the skill folder (not the category wrapper). Skip the `demo/` subfolder if there is one.

### Categories

Pick the category that best fits what the skill operates on or produces:

| Category | For skills that... |
|---|---|
| `ai/` | Are meta-skills — patterns, evaluation, self-improvement |
| `documents/` | Create or transform structured documents |
| `knowledge/` | Manage knowledge bases, research, expert routing |
| `libraries/` | Act on SharePoint document libraries (classify, organize, clean up) |
| `operations/` | Run business workflows, reports, or site-level analytics |
| `styling/` | Apply visual themes via list/column/view formatting |
| `writing/` | Generate or edit prose content |

If none fit, propose a new category in your PR description.

### Naming convention

- Folder name: **kebab-case** — lowercase, dash-separated (`organize-library`, not `OrganizeLibrary` or `organize_library`)
- The folder name must match the `name` field in `SKILL.md` exactly
- Be specific — avoid generic names like `tool`, `helper`, `processor`

### Required files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Skill instructions with `name` and `description` frontmatter |
| `README.md` | Description, what you get, and contribution credits |
| `assets/sample.json` | Metadata for the PnP community samples gallery |
| `assets/preview.png` | Screenshot of the skill's output for the samples gallery (recommended 1280×720, 16:9, PNG) |

### Optional — demo content

If your skill benefits from a hands-on demo, add a `demo/` subfolder. Include a `README.md` with setup steps and a `sample-files/` folder with the content. Users uploading the skill to SharePoint can skip `demo/` — only `SKILL.md` is required for the skill to run.

## Pre-submission checklist

Before opening your pull request, verify:

- [ ] Skill folder is inside the correct category subfolder (`Skills/<category>/<skill-name>/`)
- [ ] Folder name uses kebab-case and matches the `name` field in `SKILL.md` exactly
- [ ] `SKILL.md` has `name` and `description` in the frontmatter
- [ ] `README.md` follows the template (description, "What you get", Contribution table)
- [ ] `assets/sample.json` exists with the `url` and `thumbnails[0].url` pointing to your skill's actual path
- [ ] `assets/preview.png` exists and shows the skill's actual output (not a logo or placeholder)
- [ ] Skills work best when they are **focused** (one capability), **self-contained** (no external dependencies), and **discoverable** (clear `description` with trigger phrases)
